# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# john = User.create([{email: 'isaac.vonderau@uleth.ca'}, {password:'somethingrandom'    {provider: "facebook"}, {uid: "794483024320"}])
#
# puts "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
# puts "john.email"
